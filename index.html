					<h2>The "Why"</h2>
					
					<p>Data and code should be cited within our work for the same reasons journal articles are cited:</p>
						<p><span style="color: #57068c;">to give credit where credit is due</span> (original author/producer) and to <span style="color:	#57068c;">help other researchers find the material</span>.</p>

					<h2>Archival Storage in Repositories</h2>
										
					<span style="float:left; display:inline-block; width:55%; text-align:left;">

					<h2>Citing Code</h2>
				
					<p>To start, you would only cite code </p>

					<h2>Citing Code</h2>
				
					<p>Just like data, long-term archiving of software is best done in dedicated repositories. The two most popular are Zenodo (close to 5000 DOIs for software) and NanoHub (about 2,000 DOIs for software).</p>
					<p>NanoHub uses the open source HubZero software that integrates a subversion code repository, whereas Zenodo has built an integration with Github. The Github/Zenodo integration assigns a DOI to a particular Github release of a software repo. This is perfect for a citation, which should be specific for the software version used in a particular research project. In addition, users of software and software authors want to know who is citing or otherwise re-using all versions of the software. https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/</p>

					<h2>Citing Code: Authors vs. Contributors</h2>
				
					<p>A piece of software might be created by dozens, if not thousands of contributors. Do all of them get cited? This seems like the classic "attribution stacking" problem. Perhaps it might be better to have variations, with or without authors and/or with a pointer to contributors || There's also the difference between the maintainer(s) of a project (who is/are currently responsible for it), and the contributors (those who have committed code to the project, or made other contributions). I imagine it would be the maintainers (and possibly also previous maintainers) that would be cited, though there are bound to be exceptions.</p>

				<section>
					<h2>Citing Code: Location?? Publisher??</h2>
				
					<p>Publisher name/location is similarly difficult. If I collaborate on a project with another developer and its published on github then who is the publisher and which location do we use? Is it github? Is it the repo owner (which might be an organisation)? || I think this can be optional, but might be useful when software is produced solely by a specific university or software company. A better analogy to book publishers, though, might be the code hosting (e.g. "GitHub") or archiving (e.g. "fighare") service. The geographic location is probably irrelevant, unless it's necessary for distinguishing between multiple entities with the same name.</p>
